# MobSF-Data-Extract
This repository contains a main python script (`Main.py`) that automates the extraction and analysis of security data from Mobile applications using the MobSF REST API. 

### Note
This project is still in the works, which I am trying to plan to finish by the end of the year if it is possible. 

## Usage
1. Put the binaries into the `Binary` folder
2. Delete the folder for `Reports/JSON` and `Report/PDF`
3. Run `python Main.py` to generate the reports and information for penetration testing report
